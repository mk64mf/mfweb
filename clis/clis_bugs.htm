back</a>)</font></big></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font face="Arial" color="#00B700"><big>PC Version (1.9.3)</big></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF"><big>Bug #1 - &quot;Infinite&quot; durability on
tools and armor</big></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF"><big>In order to do this, you need a pickaxe like
for example an golden pickaxe that's been used a bit, and the materials needed to craft
it. Go to a crafting table, form the gold pickaxe, and drag it onto you'r damaged pickaxe
and boom it should be at full durability and you can keep you'r resources.</big></font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF"><big>Bug #2 - Duplicating Wheat and Corn</big></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF"><big>So just take you'r wheat or corn, craft it into
grains/seeds, and just drop them and they magically turn into wheat/corn again.</big></font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF"><big>Bug #3 - Gamma go brrr?</big></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF"><big>Sometimes when I play I get this randomly, it's
not that common but I have a picture of it.</big></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF"><big>Bug #4 - Ghosts?</big></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF"><big>Similar thing to Bug #3 but sometimes when
there's a thunder, when lightning strike I sometimes see swimming chests/cannibals when
they don't exist, I don't have any pictures for that yet but it has happened to me a
couple times by now and no I am definetly not tripping, I think it's not just swimming
chests or cannibals but pretty much every entity.</big></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF"><big>Issue #1 - Icon changes</big></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF"><big>In 1.8.1, they made the icons in the inventory
low resolution and look like shit, before they were a million times better. I can see if
they did that for optimization purposes but why not make an option for that then.</big></font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF"><big>Issue #2 - Why.</big></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF"><big>What made the developers think locking the game
at 60FPS with no option to change that is a good idea, like it's so annoying when I play
on my 165hz monitor, just make an option for users to change their FPS limit or to turn it
off and boom there you have an simple solution. It isn't that hard to change that, it's
even easier with the software the game was made on, Unity, it's probably already somewhere
online for everyone to use, they might have to do few changes to that code but it would be
a quick solution.</big></font></p>

they fucked this up</big></font></p>
