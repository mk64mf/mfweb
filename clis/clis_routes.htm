<p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial"><big>First step is to get bow and arrows in the
swimming chest and the silver axe and leather helmet hidden in the chest in the cave on
you'r starting island, wear the helmet, use that axe to get some wood and food and get 10
leather, use 2 of the leather to make a small backpack. When getting wood make sure to
only get Coconut/Mango wood, they are the fastest to break. Once you have the wood make
some stone tools and get like 40 stone, we need to make sure that we always have 40-50
stone at all times just in case we need it. Then go to F07 and now it's important you have
enough food, we will kill the natives there now with the bow and arrows and stone tools,
the trader should drop a canoe idealy. We want to use that canoe to quickly go to F08 so
we can get the gunpowder and the silver pickaxe hidden in the hidden room and get 27
silver ores with that pickaxe, if the silver pickaxe isn't enough you can use a stone
pickaxe to get silver. Now we want to go to F05 to get some coal so we can smelt the
silver, make full armor with it, 1 pickaxe and 2 swords. Now we go to E05 and kill them,
take the 2 gold blocks and take the 20 feathers from the chest in the house that has 5
chests, the feathers are in one of them lol. Now kill the fat spider at D04 and get like
17 gold ores, we would use them for the arrow heads, the gold blocks from E05 are for
future tools if we need them. Now go to B02 and kill them, you might as well switch the
canoe there with a fresh one. Then kill the huge population over at B01 and then go to G03
and kill their huge population. Try to gather as many feathers as you can while doing
that. Now we go to H04 and get the gunpowder that's in some of the chests there. Next we
go to K01 and K02 and kill them, again try to gather as many feathers from the chests, I
will post pictures below at some point but for now just quickly check them and take them.
Now we need to craft the 70 gold arrows because we will go to K11 next to kill the kraken.
Build a small tower in front of squidwards and shoot him. Assuming you built you'r small
house at water level, you need to aim above his eyes in the middle of his forehead. Next
it's important you have atleast 16 gunpowder, we want 16 explosive arrows and if you don't
have enough you need to farm them now. Go to F11, because now it's time for our beloved
cannibal boss. use you'r 16 gunpowder to make TNT, and use that to make 16 explosive
arrows, there it's important you always get feathers nearby and have some stone ready to
be used in you'r inventory. If you don't have 16 gunpowder, you need to leave the cannibal
boss alive because he will respawn cannibals over and over again, this can be used to farm
TNT/Explosive Arrows, so just kill cannibals until you have about 16 exlosive arrows and
start to kill the cannibal boss, there it's important to save from time to time,
especially here you should save just in case you die from him. Once he is killed go to
A11, kill them, take a fresh canoe and go to B06. Dig a big hole, trap the scorpion and
kill him in any way that's somewhat quick.</big></font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial"><big>First step is to get the silver axe located in
the hidden room of you'r starting Island, get some wood and food with it and make sure to
only craft the logs into planks when needed, make some stone tools and get around 70
feathers and 2 leather for a small backpack. Before we continue make sure you have 1 oak
log or 3 oak planks, now we go to F08 and get the silver pickaxe from the hidden chest,
now go to F05 and get a stack of coal (aka 100). Now go to D04 and kill the fat Spider, I
would recommend going into the cave with both coal and iron, collect the coal to have some
extra and then kill the fat Spider. Now you wanna collect so much gold that in the end you
should have about 70 gold arrow heads (need 17 gold for 72 heads), so I assume you need
about 23 gold ores including the pickaxes you need, smelt it in the cave as well and then
craft 17 gold ingots into 72 arrow heads. Now you have to use you'r 70 feathers and arrow
heads to craft them into arrows, then just get 3 string (the fat spider should drop 4
string) to make a bow with you'r 3 oak planks I told you about earlier. now make sure you
have enough blocks (about 50) and go to K11, then build a small house in front of
squidwards and shoot him. Assuming you built you'r small house at water level, you need to
aim above his eyes in the middle of his forehead. </big></font></p>
