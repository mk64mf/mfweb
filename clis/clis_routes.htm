<p><font face="Courier" color="#FFFFFF"><big><big>First step is to get the silver axe
hidden in the chest in the cave on you'r starting island, but don't use that axe on
anything yet. Next get some wood and make some stone tools, but make sure only to get
Mango/Coconut wood because they are faster to break than Oak Wood and to keep some of the
logs, just get 40 or 50 logs to be save and only craft them to planks when you need them.
Always make sure you have atleast like half a stack of stone ready to be used, also get 10
Leather and make a small backpack with 2 of the 10 Leather. Then go to F05 and get some
coal, once you got enough coal you need to go to Island E05. So once you arrive at E05 we
do not want to kill the natives yet, we don't have the materials yet, so get you'r silver
axe and break the 2 gold blocks and use a canoe to escape to D04. Once you are at D04 you
need to find a big hole with Iron/Coal in it, there you can not only get some extra coal
but also kill the spider queen pretty easily, while the coal is optional, you have to get
3 iron for the iron bow (Oak wood also works to make a wooden bow but make iron just to be
safe for now). So just kill the spider queen with a stone sword and collect the string it
dropps, you need the string for the bigger backpack and bow you will now craft IN THE
SPIDER'S CAVE. Once you crafted these 2 items, use you'r gold blocks to make a pickaxe and
a sword, keep the 3 gold that are leftover for now and just get like 40-50 gold ores from
there. When exiting D04 make sure to get any coal you see nearby and that you have gold
armor. Then go back to E05 and kill the natives and try to get some feathers and as much
gunpowder if any is dropped/nearby, then go to F06 and get so many feathers that you have
a stack, aka 100. Then take over F07 and make sure to keep gunpowder if any is dropped. If
the trader dropps a Canoe, keep it, it could help you in the future. Next is to kill the
poulation of G03 and then you need to go to H04 to get some of the gunpowder there. &nbsp;
Then just kill K01 and K02 and now it's important that you have enough Gold left because
now we need to make the arrows for the Kraken on K11. Just craft 70 arrows at max and you
should be good, so once you arrived at K11 you can build a tower and just shoot the Kraken
till it dies, assuming you are at around water level, aim above his eyes around in the
middle of his forehead and release the arrow when his legs are in the water or he doesn't
do a funny dance move or whatever that is called. Now we get to the most scary part of
this run, F11, the cannibal boss my beloved. This is the reason we had to get as much
gunpowder as possible because we need to kill the boss with that. Now with the 30 feathers
that are left make some stone arrows and Explosive Blocks so you can make Explosive
Arrows, then locate the Boss, especially here make sure that you saved, just reminding for
the better, then just shoot him as well as you can with the hopes he dies. Once our
beloved cannibal boss died (lmfao) we are going to A11 to kill them. Now depending on how
much durability our canoe still has, we may have to use it soon. Just make you'r way to
B06, make a big hole, trap the scorpion and kill it somehow, anything somewhat quick works
really just be careful. and then just kill our friends over at B02 and B01 and as soon as
the last native's body despawned the run is done.</big></big></font></p>
